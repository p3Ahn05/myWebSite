<img src="images/Albert.jpg" width="400"/>

<p> Albert Einstein was born in Germany on March 14, 1876. Einstein and his family moved around quite a lot during his childhood, from Wurttemberg, to Munich, to Italy, and finally to Switzerland. After acquiring a Swiss citizenship he became a technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office where he achieved many of his incredible feats. After that job, he became a professor and worked at a multitude of colleges. That is the beginning of Albert Einstein's life, a man who would go on to change the world.

<p> During his life Einstein came up with many theories and equations that would change how people viewed the universe. His most famous equation was E=mc2 which means "energy equals mass times the speed of light squared". This equation led to the invention of atomic weapons and in turn changed the tide of World War II, which is why it is such a famous equation. During Albert Einstein's life he married Mileva Maric and had three children, two sons and one daughter. Einstein died on April 18, 1955 at Princeton, New Jersey although, he still lives on in his unprecedented studies.
